<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

I adore Studio Ghibli films, so I created this web application to highlight some of my favorites from the studio. In short, the simplicity of the characters and story lines, as well as the rather unique approach to storytelling, is what makes Studio Ghibli films so great and enjoyable for both adults and children.

### Built With

• Designed a streaming service website with GraphCMS, GraphQL, React and Next.js.

• Built backend with GraphCMS and synchronized job queue with Mutation and Query on GraphQL API.

• Developed Next.js based frontend with npm, React, and Tailwind CSS.
